Implement various clustering algorithms in colabs

 

submit one colab per assignment - provide complete colab with proper documentation etc.,. 

 

a) K-Means clustering from scratch

or https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/notebooks/05.11-K-Means.ipynb (Links to an external site.)

b) Hierarchical clustering (not from scratch)

c) Gaussian mixture models clustering (not from scratch)

d) DB Scan clustering (not from scratch) using pycaret library

Please ensure you provide proper measures of clustering quality as well. See attached colabs for examples.

use colabs as inspiration.
